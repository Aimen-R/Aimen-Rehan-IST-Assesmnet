                <h6> <b>Our History</b></h6>
                <p>Our firm was founded by Daniel Goldstien, who commenced his career in law in 1999 when, as a first year law student, he was employed at Dibbs Crowther  & Osborne.  After completing his law degree in 2004, Craig was employed as a solicitor with Dibbs Crowther & Osborne in the litigation group.  In those early years, Craig gained experience acting for major banks and companies operating in the financial sector, including National Australia Bank, and acted in some of the biggest insolvency administrations coming out of the late 80’s and early 90’s.</p>
                <p>By the late 2000’s, Craig had became a partner at a large Sydney mid tier law firm and later moved his practice to a national mid tier law firm, in the role as practice leader of the commercial dispute resolution team in Sydney.  In this role, Craig lead a team of lawyers and paralegals, acting for major players in the Retail sector including Coles, Bunnings, Kmart and Stockland.</>
                <p>In 2017, Craig founded his own independent law firm operating in the Sydney CBD and operated for a short period in partnership.  Subsequently Craig founded the firm Teneo Corporate Lawyers with a team of exceptional lawyers, paralegals and staff.  Teneo Corporate Lawyers now have offices in the Sydney CBD and North Sydney, and act for multi nationals, listed corporations and small to medium enterprise across all sectors, but with a focus on the Retail, Finance and Manufacturing sectors.</p>
